* If the program `tcpquotad' (or any other program in this package) complain
  about `Can't find loadable object for module Msql in @INC ...', then
  it can't find the Msql library. To rectify this, cd to `/usr/lib' and enter
  the command: `ln -s ../local/lib/site_perl/i486-linux/auto/Msql/Msql.so',
  hopfully that will fix the problem. If not, find the file `Msql.so' with
  the help of `locate Msql.so', then make the link to the path that `locate'
  tells you. If `locate' can't find the Msql library, then it means that you
  don't have the msqlperl package properly installed.

* If the program `tcpquotad' won't start, saying access denied, make sure
  you can connect to the MSQL server on localhost. Try typing the following:
  `msql -h localhost <database>', if that fail, you have not configured or
  started MSQLd properly...

  It could be helped if you set the environment variables 'MSQL_TCP_PORT'
  and 'MSQL_UNIX_PORT'. See the manual page for 'msqld'...
