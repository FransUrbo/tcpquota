Description: A dialout/masquerading monitoring package.
 TCPQuota  monitors and debit users depending on there
 online time  (dialout). The program is made for those
 who  have a  local network  with  a server  that also
 functions as a Internet gateway (among other things).
 .
 The  server  runs diald,  for example, which does the
 actual  dial-on-demand,  and this package which debit
 each  user,   wheter  from  the   server  or  from  a
 masqueraded host  (program includes masquerade code).

 do  is run  the command 'openhost',  and the hostname
 and username  is masqueraded  and debited acording to
 the time they spend calling out.
