tcpquota (1.6.15-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated the dependecy on perl/perl5.
  * Upgraded standards-version to 2.5.1
  * Removed dependency to mysql-base | msql. The libdbd*-perl packages
    do already depends on what is needed.
  * Moved to main since libdbd-mysql-perl is in main now.
  * Uploaded with full source because of this.
    Closes: #41497

tcpquota (1.6.15-6) unstable; urgency=low, closes=28387

  * Fixing postinst/config scripts. Ask for mySQL user and password, so
    that the database can be created and the daemon reloaded corrected.
  * Start tcpquotad without the `-w' switch to perl...
  * Fixing bashism in post{inst|rm}.
  * Fixing spelling errors in description.
  * Wrong name of init script (tcpquotad, should be tcpquota).

tcpquota (1.6.15-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed bugs with 'prepate', instead of 'prepare'.
  * More signal handlers, to try to find out why the daemon dies suddenly.
  * Found some missing ';' in tcpquotaadmin.

 -- Turbo Fredriksson <turbo@debian.org>  Thu, 15 Oct 1998 17:10:26 -0700

tcpquota (1.6.15-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a little bug conserning the postinst. If we didn't say yes to the 
    question 'Would you like to reconfigure', we don't restart the daemon.

 -- Turbo Fredriksson <turbo@debian.org>  Fri, 18 Sep 1998 19:14:58 -0700

tcpquota (1.6.15-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Found and corrected some bugs regarding uninitialized variables.
  * Added a '--nofork' option to the daemon, to aid in debugging.
  * Changed the Depends line... This hopfully catches everything we should
    depend on...
  * Missed a 'query' in the 'openhost' script. Should be 'prepare'.
    Also try to center the 'Please press ENTER ...' and add a empty line
    after this line, to make it more visible.
  * Fixed a (serious) spelling error in the daemon... 'prepate', should be
    'prepare'...                                            ^
  * Problem with variables in the tcpquotaconfig script... Somethimes
    I mix up the initialization of bash/sh variables and perl variables...
  * Rewrote the post{rm,inst} a little. Mismatched `"' in postrm, and
    added 'case "$1" in' in the postinst script, so that we don't try
    to reconfigure a package we are about to remove/purge...
  * Fixed 'newline' bug in the 'tcp_masq_openhost' script
  * Fixed some 'ne/eq' bugs regarding the feching from the database
    (also don't prepare the same statement twice, no need to).

tcpquota (1.6.15-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved to use 'libdbi-perl' instead of libmsql-perl, which means that
    one can use mySQL (or perhaps even PostgreSQL) instead of mSQL which
    is pretty slow...
    .
    This means different depends, different post{inst,rm} and some changes
    in the config file.
      New options:
        ENGINE         => Which database engine should we use?
        CHECK_LOCAL    => Should we ever check connections FROM us?
        VERIFY         => How often should we check that the link is really up?
      Changed options:
        SERVER         => Now includes the port to the SQL server to.
    .
    Ask more questions in the postinst and tcpquotaconfig, so that the
    system is more workable 'out-of-the-box'...
  * Some bugfixes in the library.
    Somehow, somewhere the who and w output changed. If we are running
    in a screen or X, we don't get the hostname if local any more, just
    '(:0:S.2)' for example...
    .
    Check the last three minutes worth of masquerading connects instead of
    the last PERIOD sekonds..
  * Fixed some bugs and added some options in the main daemon.
    Support for a permanent link, no need to check any online and the like.
    We can still use TCPQuota for logging connections... Yeah, right... :)
    .
    Support for checking ProFTPd connections... ProFTPd announces it's presence
    a little different than wu-ftpd... This time I think I made it more
    universal... Nock on wood... :)
    .
    Fixed (?) the problem with the disconnection from the SQL server.. Have
    something to do with signals.
    .
    If the 'Net link was down, 'openhost' just sat there, doin' nothing. Fixed.
  * In 'openhost', don't close the firewall or notify the user incase he/she
    is on the 'free' list...
  * Support both libc5 AND 6, just incase ([uw]tmp files differ, so does
    the 'include' files...)
  * More (better ?) online help.
  * Use debhelper.

tcpquota (1.6.14-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * NEW IN OPENFW:
  * Added an option to force closing a specified host, and to open/close
    a specified group of hosts, specifying just one of the hosts.
  * Added the option to list the firewall entries.
  .
  * NEW IN OPENHOST:
  * Better and (hopefully) more descriptive error messages.
  * Tell the user if the daemon (or other script etc) have closed the
    firewall for him/her, and exit cleanly.
  .
  * NEW IN TCPQUOTAD:
  * Added support for more than one local network.
  * Make _ABSOLUTELY_ sure that we find the correct user, checking against
    our local domains.
  * New signal handlers, USR[12] which turn on resp turn off debugging.
  * Try to send a SMB message if we have to close the firewall to the
    user in question.
  * Fixed the bug that sometimes killed the daemon after killing a
    non-allowed users processes.
  .
  * NEW IN TCPQUOTA.PL:
  * Fixed the checking a connect against the local net (make sure it is
    _NOT_ one of our own local networks).
  * Made the libc5 and libc6 work independently, from the same code.
    (We just recently switched to libc6 on our Internet server).
  * Security fixed a open();
  * If we can not find the IP number the user is coming from from the
    UTMP file (which we often can not on a libc5 machine), try to find it
    through a DNS lookup instead.
  * Speeded up the database fetching quite a loot, by specifying the
    exact entry. Added some new params to be able to do this, since they
    where local variables.
  * Officially added support for libc6 UTMP file.
  .
  * OTHER:
  * Started hacking on a 'chkisdnlog', which give some status on the ISDN
    usage.
  * Improved the manuals a little... I do this when I have time over, but
    I'm administring 30 machines, and teaching fulltime, so... :)
  .
  * BUG FIXES:
  * Fixed some bugs in the 'openfw' script, concerning the parsing and
    execution of the corresponding code.

  * Forgot to change the call to one of the columns in the
    masq table in the mSQL database
  * Fixed the lintian bug, wrong-name-for-upstream-changelog
  * Two new SIG handlers, USR1 and USR2 which turn on and off
    debugging
  * Better man page for the daemon, more info

  * More verbosity
  * Make sure the 'openhost' script quits cleanly if someone/
    something have closed the firewall for the opened host
  .

    I can't find out _WHY_ it sometimes dies after killing
    a  non-allowed users processes
  * Added the feature to fore a close of a host
  * Added the feature to extract a specific user's log entries
  * Added the feature to open/close a specific group other
    than the host/group your are comming from

    check that they exists in the database (also works on groups)
