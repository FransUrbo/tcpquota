This is TCPQuota, a  program that logs all  foreign TCP activity using
'/proc/net/*' and writes to the mySQL database 'tcpquota'.

  The program is made for those who have a local network with a server
that also functions  as a Internet  gateway (among other things).  The
server runs diald, for  example, which does the actual dial-on-demand,
and this package debits each  user, whether from the  server or from a
masqueraded host (program includes masquerade code).

  All  a user from inside the  gateway/firewall have to  do is run the
command 'tcp_masq_openhost' (or the link 'openhost'), and the hostname
and username  is masqueraded  and debited according  to the  time they
spend calling out.

  This   software  is in  use daily  at  CCW  (Computer  Club West) in
Gothenburg, Sweden, and our phone bill depend on it...
