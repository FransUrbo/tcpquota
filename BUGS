1. When a user  logs  in to  the system,  '/bin/login'  does  not always
   records the IP address of the  host the user  is connecting from... If
   you are using a login program that uses libc6, this is not true, since
   libc6 is using a different kind of utmp file...

   You can check if your login program is using libc5 or libc6 by issuing
   the following command:

     ldd /bin/login

   If you get the following line:

     libc.so.5 => /lib/libc.so.5

   Then...  You  are  using libc5...  :) The  problem   only occurs when
   someone is  logging in via telnet/rsh/rlogin _AND_  is  coming from a
   host with a very long FQDN (Fully  Qualified Domain Name) _AND_ we are
   checking for remote connects, 'CHECK_REMOTE=1'...

   This bug is out  of my hands,  it's up to  you to upgrade the lib  and
   login program...  This  is not _THAT_ very  serious though, some users
   might slip through, but...
